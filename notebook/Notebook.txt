##why to learn about DSA in Javascript.
--big tech companies are seeking for developer that know DSA, also is used to filter Developer 
when applying for a Tech job.
other reason to learn about DSA in Javascript: 
1. Efficient problem Solving
2. Algorithmic Awareness
3.Stronger Coding Skills.
4.Interview Success 
5.Coding Confidence
6.Efficient Programming 
7.Critical Thinking Champion

but the biggest reason to learn about DSA  is that is going to help yout become a :
PROBLEM SOLVER.



## DATA Structure: 
Data Structure is a way of organizing,storing, and accessing data. 

## Algorithm: 
Is a set of instructions that tell a computer how do to something, or you can also say 
a STEP-BY-STEP solutino of the problem called algorithm.

## PROBLEM 1 : 

create an  array with5 students names, after that create a function which takes 2 parameters
(allStudents & studentsNames) iterate over all students and find that specific user "studentName"
